# Elevator-project-in-CODESYS
## An elevator project in five-storey building written in Ladder Diagram (LD) programming language

For executing this project, you need to install CODESYS software from https://www.codesys.com/.

Every floor of the 5-floor building contains bottom and top limit switches, which are pressed manually. There is a 7 seconds timer for opening the elevetor door, and a 10 seconds timer for opening the door again if none of the buttons inside the elevator cabin are pressed. 

The elevator operates based on the current direction and the direction imposed by up and call button on each floor. 

Please, watch the video demonstration to see the full logic of the program.

Good luck!
